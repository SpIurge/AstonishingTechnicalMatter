"Develop additional classes for Cat, Cow ,and Dog that will 1) inherit publicly from Mammal,and 2) override the move and speak functions. For animal x (could be dog, cat, or duck), the move function should simply output a line x moves a step. For the speak function: 
For dogs, output a line: Woof! Woof! 
For cats, output a line: Meow! Meow! 
For cows, output a line: Moo! Moo!
